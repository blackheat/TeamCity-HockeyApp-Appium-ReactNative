## A. Integrating Kobiton with TeamCity
### 1. Preparation
#### 1.1. Getting Kobiton Username and API key
Kobiton Username and API key are required for authenticating with Kobiton API.

> If you don't have a Kobiton account, visit https://portal.kobiton.com/register to create one.

To get your Kobiton Username and API Key, follow instructions at `IV. Configure Test Script for Kobiton` section on [our blog](https://kobiton.com/blog/tutorial/parallel-testing-selenium-webdriver/).

#### 1.2. Samples
To give you an in-depth demonstration of the integration flow, we have provided samples:
- Script (written in NodeJS) for executing automation test on Kobiton devices : [automation-test-script.js](/samples/automation-test/automation-test-script.js).

You can check out the sample content or keep reading because they are used in below steps as well.

### 2. Setup
#### 2.1 Getting started
Follow steps below to get started:

1. Fork this repository.
2. Synchronize the forked repository with TeamCity.
> Refer to https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/TCD18/Creating+and+Editing+Projects for instructions on how to synchronize a repository with TeamCity.

#### 2.2. Setting Kobiton Username and API key
In your project configuration in TeamCity, add two environment variables :
- `KOBITON_USERNAME` : Your Kobiton's username.
- `KOBITON_API_KEY` : Your Kobiton's API Key.

Your `Environment Variables` window should look like this

![Environment variables](./assets/env-variables-after-add.png)

#### 2.3. Setting Kobiton device desired capabilities
In order to execute tests on a specific device in Kobiton, its corresponding desired capabilities needs to be supplied.

The provided automation testing script has been pre-configured to execute automation test of a demo Android application on a random, available Android devices.

**Demo application details**
```
- Filename: `ApiDemos-debug.apk`
- Download link: https://appium.github.io/appium/assets/ApiDemos-debug.apk
```

If you want to execute on a specific device, refer to instructions below to get the corresponding desired capabilities for that device.

1. Go to https://portal.kobiton.com/login and login with your Kobiton account.
2. Click **"Devices"** at the top of the window.

![Devices button](./assets/devices-button.png)

3. Hover over the device you want to execute on (in this example: `Pixel 2 XL`), click the gear button.

![Automation Settings button](./assets/gear-button.png)

4. In the `Automation Settings` popup:
- In `Language` section, choose `NodeJS`.
- In `App Type` section, choose `Hybrid/Native from Url`.
- In `Application Url` section, put `https://appium.github.io/appium/assets/ApiDemos-debug.apk`.

```javascript
var desiredCaps = { 
  sessionName:        'Sample Automation Test Session',
  sessionDescription: 'This is a sample automation test session', 
  deviceOrientation:  'portrait',  
  captureScreenshots: false, 
  app:                'https://appium.github.io/appium/assets/ApiDemos-debug.apk',
  deviceGroup:        'KOBITON', 
  groupId:            100,
  deviceName:         'Pixel 2 XL',
  platformVersion:    '8.1.0',
  platformName:       'Android'

#### 2.4. Configuring TeamCity project
In your project settings, follow steps below to configure your TeamCity project:
1. Add a `Build Configuration`.

![Build Configuration](./assets/build-configuration.png)

2. In your newly added `Build Configuration`, add a new `Build Step` with the following details:
- Runner type: `Command Line`
- Working directory: `samples/automation-test`
- Run: `Custom script`
- Custom script:
```bash
npm install
npm run automation-test-script
```

![Build Step](./assets/build-step-without-docker.png)

Here is the in-depth explanation of the above script in `Custom script` section:
- Install missing dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

- Execute automation test script on Kobiton
```bash
npm run automation-test-script
```

**Note** : If you want to execute the provided script in Docker, please add some configurations in `Docker Settings` in your build step:
- Run step within Docker container: `node:latest`
- Docker image platform: `Any`
